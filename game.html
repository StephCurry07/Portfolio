        <h2>Supercell</h2>
        My in-game name is Stephen Curry for the supercell games. I made COC account before supercell IDs were launched. Then some time after Supercell ID was launched then I created it with the same name, and hence the name.

                <h3>Clash of Clans</h3>
                <p>
                    I started it in class 11th when my friends talked about playing the game. It was summer and I installed it so that I can also enjoy the conversations they were having. I have a Town Hall level 12 and a Builder Hall level 9. I'm currently in Master League II, in a clan with my friends. With an experience level of 179, I have accumulated a total of 3,154 builder trophies, and also reached Legend League with TH10, showcasing my prowess in both regular and Builder Base attacks. A seasoned participant in Clan Wars, I have secured 629 war stars and actively engage in competitive trophy pushing, illustrating my commitment to strategic gameplay.</p>

                <h3>Brawl Stars</h3>
                <p>It launched in December(India) when I was in class 12th. I installed it the next day after it launched. Made my friends installed and had fun. I currently have around 23000 trophies. I stopped playing due to academic and career reasons as I became a bit competitive here. I was trophy pushing whole night while I had to give JEE exam. I deleted it from my phone so that I don't play, asked my mom for her phone as I installed it there. Once I was India rank 27 with Shelly and similar under 100 with Bull and Jacky as well. My mom told me once 'itna hi pdhai mein bhi karlo', then it hit me hehe. Now, so many brawlers and many new things are there. But they recently also changed the theme musiccc.</p>

                <h3>Clash Royale</h3>
                <p>I just started it after my 7th sem as some of my college friends played it and asked me to. I'm a newbie here.
                    Saw a little bit interest in it neararound 1200. Now, I just play it while getting bored and closing COC, then remembering oh let's donate and request cards and collect achievment. That's it.
